# Yes, CARLA CAN

**Yes, CARLA CAN** is an automotive cybersecurity experimentation platform that extends the [CARLA](https://carla.org/) driving simulator with a virtual [CAN bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus). It lets you run attack and defense experiments against a simulated vehicle network without any dedicated hardware.

This work was accepted for the Salão de Ferramentas of the Simpósio Brasileiro de Redes de Computadores e Sistemas Distribuídos (SBRC) 2026 and is currently under revision by the Artifact Technical Committee.

## Architecture overview

The project architecture and its main modules are presented in the following figure:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/yes-we-can-architecture.png" alt="Yes, CARLA CAN — architecture overview">
</p>

The platform is composed of the following modules:

- **Virtual CAN Bus (SocketCAN)** — a kernel-level virtual network interface (`vcan0`) that acts as the shared communication medium. All other modules connect to it to send or receive CAN frames, mimicking a real in-vehicle bus.
- **CAN DBC Network Configuration** — a DBC file (`data/carla.dbc`) that defines the message IDs, signal encoding, and transmission periods for the virtual network. It is the single source of truth for the CAN message schema used across all modules.
- **CARLA Client Module** (`CARLA_client_module.py`) — connects to the CARLA simulator server, spawns the ego vehicle, and attaches the sensors used in the simulation: collision, GNSS, IMU, lane invasion, and radar.
- **Vehicle Controls Module** (`vehicle_controls_module.py`) — captures keyboard inputs and translates them into CAN frames according to the DBC schema, publishing them onto `vcan0` to control the simulated vehicle.
- **Cyberattacks Module** (`cyberattacks_module.py`) — injects malicious CAN frames onto the bus. Supports Denial-of-Service (DoS) flooding and reverse-engineering-based feature spoofing (e.g. forcing hand brake or lights).
- **Intrusion Detection Module** (`intrusion_detection_module.py`) — listens to `vcan0` in real time and applies statistical detection algorithms to identify anomalous traffic patterns and raise alerts.

The network node modules (CARLA client, vehicle controls, cyberattacks and intrusion detection) run concurrently on a single machine, making experiments fully self-contained and reproducible. Each layer is also independently extensible — new attack types, detection algorithms, or vehicle configurations can be integrated by following the existing module structure.

The modules in execution will look like the ones in the following image:

# Considered Badges

The considered badges are: Available, Functional, Sustainable, and Reproducible.

---

# Basic Information

**Hardware** (tested configuration):

| Component | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Machine** | Lenovo ThinkPad L14 |
| **CPU** | 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 @ 2.40GHz (4 cores / 8 threads, up to 4.2 GHz) |
| **RAM** | 16 GB (shared with GPU if using an integrated graphics card) |
| **GPU** | Intel Iris Xe Graphics (Tiger Lake TGL GT2) — integrated GPU, Vulkan-capable |
| **Storage** | ≥ 27 GB free (CARLA 0.9.15: ~27 GB; remaining platform files: ~22 MB) |

> **Note:** The CARLA simulator dominates disk usage. Ensure at least 27 GB of free storage is available before running the install script.

> **Note:** The platform was tested on an integrated GPU that shares system RAM with the CPU, and it runs well for the experiments described in this README under that configuration. For heavier CARLA workloads, [CARLA's official repository](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla) recommends a dedicated GPU (NVIDIA RTX 3070 / 3080 / 4090).

**Software**:

| Component | Specification |
|---|---|
| **OS** | Ubuntu/Debian-based Linux (tested on Debian GNU/Linux 13 — Trixie and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish) |
| **Package manager** | conda / Miniconda |
| **Python** | 3.9 |

> **Note:** Python 3.9 is managed by conda inside the `n4s_env` environment created by the install script. You do not need to change or downgrade your system Python.

> **Note:** All experiments were conducted on Ubuntu/Debian systems. Behaviour on Windows/WSL or macOS was not tested.

# Dependencies

"Yes, CARLA CAN" depends on the following software components:

| Dependency | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **conda / Miniconda** | any | Python virtual environment management |
| **Python** | 3.9 | Runtime (managed by conda inside `n4s_env`) |
| **carla** | 0.9.15 | Python client for the CARLA simulator |
| **cantools** | see `requirements.txt` | DBC file parsing and CAN frame encoding/decoding |
| **python-can** | see `requirements.txt` | SocketCAN interface for sending/receiving CAN frames |
| **dash** | see `requirements.txt` | Web-based CAN traffic visualisation dashboard |
| **matplotlib** | see `requirements.txt` | Plotting and data visualisation |
| **CARLA 0.9.15** | 0.9.15 | Autonomous driving simulator (server) |
| **can-utils** | Linux system package | Kernel modules and CLI tools for the virtual CAN interface (`vcan0`) |
| **libvulkan1** | Linux system package | Vulkan runtime required by the CARLA (UE4) binary, even in headless/offscreen mode |
| **mesa-vulkan-drivers** | Linux system package | Mesa Vulkan ICD; provides the software Vulkan implementation on machines without a discrete GPU |
| **curl** | Linux system package | Used by the install script to download the Miniconda installer |
| **wget** | Linux system package | Used by the install script to download the CARLA binary |

All Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. The full installation is handled automatically by the provided script — see the [Installation](#installation) section.

---

# Security Concerns

The installation and setup process requires elevated privileges (`sudo`) on the user's machine for two operations:

1. **System package installation**: `0_install_dependencies.sh` calls `apt-get install` for `can-utils`, `curl`, `wget`, `libvulkan1`, and `mesa-vulkan-drivers`, which requires `sudo` access.
2. **Kernel module loading**: `1_up_environment.sh` loads the `vcan` Linux kernel module via `modprobe vcan` and creates a virtual network interface (`vcan0`), which also requires `sudo`.

The virtual CAN interface (`vcan0`) is entirely software-defined and isolated from any real vehicle network and from the internet. It poses no risk to physical hardware or external systems.

---

# Installation

Run the install script once. It will handle everything, prompting you only if Miniconda is not yet present:

```bash
./0_install_dependencies.sh
```

What the script does:
1. Installs `can-utils`, `curl`, `wget`, `libvulkan1`, and `mesa-vulkan-drivers` via `apt-get`.
2. Checks for `conda`; if absent, offers to download and install Miniconda automatically.
3. Creates the `n4s_env` conda environment with Python 3.9 (skips if it already exists).
4. Installs all Python packages from `requirements.txt` into `n4s_env`.
5. Downloads and extracts CARLA 0.9.15 into the `carla-0-9-15/` folder.

After this step, all dependencies are installed and the platform is ready to be executed.

---

# Minimal Test - Starting the simulation environment

You can bring the core simulation up with the following command:

```bash
./1_up_environment.sh
```

You should see an output like the following, meaning that the environment was properly brought up:

```bash
Starting CARLA simulator...
Setting up virtual CAN bus...
Waiting for CARLA to start...
4.26.2-0+++UE4+Release-4.26 522 0
Disabling core dumps.
Starting CARLA client module...
Starting vehicle controls module...
Environment is up!
```

After a few seconds, the keyboard and CARLA client window will properly appear.

#### Possible issues

<details>
<summary><strong>Check if virtualCAN was properly set up</strong></summary>

You can verify that the virtual CAN interface was created successfully:

```bash
ifconfig
```

`vcan0` should appear in the list of network interfaces:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ifconfig_vcan0.png" alt="ifconfig output showing vcan0">
</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Vulkan configuration (if the simulator fails to start)</strong></summary>

On some Ubuntu systems, CARLA may not start correctly due to graphics driver issues. Install and configure Vulkan to resolve this:

```bash
vkconfig
```

Select the configuration shown below:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/vulkan_config_highlighted.png" alt="Vulkan configuration">
</p>

Close `vkconfig` and re-run `1_up_environment.sh`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>CARLA selects the Intel GPU instead of NVIDIA (hybrid GPU systems)</strong></summary>

On machines with both an Intel integrated GPU and an NVIDIA GPU, Vulkan may default to the Intel device and cause CARLA to crash. This might happen with Intel GPUs whose Vulkan support is incomplete or experimental. The error will look like:

```
MESA-INTEL: warning: Haswell Vulkan support is incomplete
VulkanRHI::vkMapMemory(...) failed, VkResult=-5
with error VK_ERROR_MEMORY_MAP_FAILED
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

`1_up_environment.sh` automatically searches for an NVIDIA Vulkan ICD file (`nvidia_icd*.json`) across the standard system locations (`/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d` and `/etc/vulkan/icd.d`) and forces its use by setting `VK_ICD_FILENAMES` before launching CARLA. No manual action is required if the NVIDIA driver is properly installed.

If the issue persists, you can force a specific ICD file manually. The path may vary depending on your system and driver version — it is typically under `/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/` or `/etc/vulkan/icd.d/`, but the exact location may differ:

```bash
VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json ./1_up_environment.sh
```

</details>

<br>

Internally, `1_up_environment.sh`:
1. Launches the **CARLA simulator** in headless, low-quality mode (`-RenderOffScreen -quality_level=Low`) to minimise resource usage.
2. Creates the **virtual CAN bus** (`vcan0`) using the Linux kernel `vcan` module.
3. Waits 5 seconds for CARLA to initialise.
4. Starts the **CARLA client module** (`CARLA_client_module.py`) — spawns the vehicle and sensors.
5. Starts the **vehicle controls module** (`vehicle_controls_module.py`) — translates vehicle state into CAN frames and puts them on `vcan0`.

To confirm the virtual CAN bus is active and producing traffic, run in a separate terminal:

```bash
candump vcan0
```

You should see CAN frames scrolling in real time. This will make you have three screens, one with the CARLA client, another with the vehicle controls and the third with the virtual CAN bus traffic, like in the following Figure:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/carla_simulator_canbus.png" alt="CARLA simulator alongside candump CAN traffic">
</p>

You can watch the same demonstration in the following video:

<p align="center">

    ▶ Watch: Keyboard-controlled vehicle driving with live CAN traffic on vcan0
  </a>
</p>

When you are done, tear everything down cleanly:

```bash
./2_down_environment.sh
```

The script stops the vehicle controls module, then the CARLA client module (waiting up to 10 seconds for a clean exit before force-killing), then the CARLA server, and finally removes `vcan0` and unloads the `vcan` kernel module.

You should see an output like the following, meaning that the environment was properly brought down:

```bash
Stopping vehicle controls module...
vehicle_controls_module (PID 10272 10291) stopped.
Stopping CARLA client module...
Waiting for CARLA_client_module (PID 10271 10292) to exit...
CARLA_client_module (PID 10271 10292) stopped.
Stopping CARLA simulator...
CARLA (PID 10158 10169) stopped.
FUnixPlatformMisc::RequestExitWithStatus
FUnixPlatformMisc::RequestExit
Bringing virtual CAN bus down...
Environment is down!
```

# Experiments

For all the following experiments below, the environment must already be up (`1_up_environment.sh` has been run). Each experiment is independent and can be stopped at any time with `Ctrl+C`.

## Experiment #0 - Defining network messages and transmission periods

We use the industry-standard CAN Database (DBC) file to specify the message parameters and transmission periods. We provide a ready-to-use DBC file at [`data/carla.dbc`](data/carla.dbc). Running the platform as-is will use this pre-configured DBC file.

A preview of the [`data/carla.dbc`](data/carla.dbc) is shown down below. In it, we define the messages' CAN IDs, signals sizes and lengths, scales and offsets, and minimum and maximum values. We use a DBC attribute to define the custom attribute "GenMsgCycleTime", which sets the transmission period of each message. For more information on DBC file syntax, see [CSS Electronics — CAN DBC File Explained](https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/can-dbc-file-database-intro).

**Note:** For more details on how to create custom DBC files, refer to the [Advanced usage - Customizing network messages and periods](#advanced-usage---customizing-network-messages-and-periods) section.

The following experiments consider the usage of the default [`data/carla.dbc`](data/carla.dbc) file.

## Experiment #1 — Hand brake spoofing attack

As part of the cybersecurity experimentation, we provide a ready-to-use cyberattacks module. This module needs the same dependencies installed in the conda environment, so be sure to use it within the environment. To see the available attacks, run the following command:

```bash
conda run --no-capture-output -n n4s_env python3 cyberattacks_module.py --help
```

The output should look like the following:
```bash
CAN network attacks CLI
usage: cyberattacks_module.py [-h]
                              [--feature {hand_brake,doors,reverse,high_beam,internal_lights,low_beam,fog_lights,lights_off,position_lights,left_blink,right_blink,fuzzy,denial_of_service}]
                              [--period PERIOD]

Perform CAN network attacks.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --feature {hand_brake,doors,reverse,high_beam,internal_lights,low_beam,fog_lights,lights_off,position_lights,left_blink,right_blink,fuzzy,denial_of_service}
                        Feature to attack
  --period PERIOD       Period between messages in seconds
```

This lists all available attacks. Attacks that correspond directly to a vehicle function (e.g., `hand_brake`, `doors`) are spoofing attacks targeting those features. You also need to specify `--period`, which defines the time interval between attack messages sent onto the virtual CAN network.

To perform the `hand_brake` spoofing attack, run the following command:

```bash
conda run --no-capture-output -n n4s_env python3 cyberattacks_module.py --feature hand_brake --period 0.001
```

This floods the bus with messages on CAN ID `0x604` (per the default DBC file), keeping the hand brake permanently activated in the CARLA client window, as shown below. As a result, the vehicle cannot move even if you press the throttle.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/carla_hand_brake_spoofing_attack.png" alt="Hand brake spoofing attack in CARLA">
</p>

You can also see the practical effect of the hand_brake attack in the simulated vehicle in the following video:

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ps3my8ZaApw0_7h0mjAC8QWvaetcpGek/view">
    ▶ Watch: Hand brake spoofing attack demo
  </a>
</p>

**Note:** To stop the attack, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the command is running.

## Experiment #2 — Fuzzy attack

Another available attack is the fuzzy attack, which consists of sending random valid messages at arbitrary intervals to trigger different vehicle functions. To conduct this attack, run the following command:

```bash
conda run --no-capture-output -n n4s_env python3 cyberattacks_module.py --feature fuzzy --period 0.05
```

As a result, various vehicle functions are triggered without any keyboard input. This attack is commonly used to discover vulnerabilities by mapping the effect of tampered messages across different CAN IDs. You can see the practical effect of the fuzzy attack in the video below:

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19_SIqONoN83gpm924XBQ9UwdElETfSZr/view">
    ▶ Watch: Fuzzy attack demo
  </a>
</p>

As shown in the video, once the attack starts, vehicle functions such as doors and lights are activated randomly.

## Experiment #3 — Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

The intrusion detection module is extensible. The currently available algorithm is a simple statistical IDS that flags messages whose inter-arrival period deviates from the baseline. To see how to use it, run the following command:

```bash
conda run --no-capture-output -n n4s_env python3 intrusion_detection_module.py --help
```

The following help output should appear:

```bash
Intrusion Detection System for CAN Bus
usage: intrusion_detection_module.py [-h] --detector {id_time}

Intrusion Detection System for CAN Bus

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --detector {id_time}  Intrusion detection algorithm to use. Available options: id_time
```

To run the intrusion detection module with the available algorithm, open a separate terminal and run:

```bash
conda run --no-capture-output -n n4s_env python3 intrusion_detection_module.py --detector id_time
```

A log similar to the following will be printed periodically:

```bash
Regular messages: 455
Total intrusions: {
  "0x60d": 21,
  "0x602": 19,
  "0x603": 56,
  "0x600": 27,
  "0x606": 12,
  "0x607": 14,
  "0x60C": 3,
  "0x601": 52,
  "0x604": 30
```

This output shows the count of regular messages and detected intrusions per CAN ID. Note that this algorithm is intentionally simple and may produce false positives — users are encouraged to implement more sophisticated detection methods.

The figure below shows the IDS output during the hand brake spoofing attack described in Claim #1:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/carla_intrusion_detection_hand_brake_spoofing.png" alt="Intrusion detection while a hand brake spoofing attack is happening.">

</p>

## Experiment #4 — Collecting network traffic

Beyond observing live traffic, another benefit of the virtual CAN bus is the ability to record traffic logs for further analysis. Using the built-in `can-utils` tooling, this is as simple as:

```bash
candump -l vcan0
```

This writes logs to a file named `candump-YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.log`, as shown below:

```bash
cat candump-2026-03-28_133445.log
(1774715685.861121) vcan0 606#00
(1774715685.877301) vcan0 600#00000000
(1774715685.877363) vcan0 601#00000000
(1774715685.877398) vcan0 602#7F000000
(1774715685.941147) vcan0 603#01
(1774715685.941226) vcan0 604#00
```

Such logs can be used for traffic analysis and as training data for machine learning-based intrusion detection systems. As future work, we plan to generate automatically labeled captures to further support machine learning experiments.

# Advanced usage - Customizing network messages and periods

The virtual CAN network is configured via a DBC file. You can change CAN IDs and transmission periods without touching any code, which is useful, for example, when evaluating how well a detection algorithm generalises to a different network configuration.

## Supported messages and signals

The platform currently supports a fixed set of messages. The DBC file must define **all required messages** (with the exact signal names listed below) for the platform to start. Optional messages may be omitted. Signal names must match exactly — the platform validates them at startup and exits with a clear error if they don't.

| Message name | Signal name | Required | Default period | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `THROTTLE` | `THROTTLE_signal` | ✅ Yes | 100 ms | Throttle value (0–255, maps to 0–100%) |
| `BRAKE` | `BRAKE_signal` | ✅ Yes | 100 ms | Brake value (0–255, maps to 0–100%) |
| `STEER` | `STEER_signal` | ✅ Yes | 100 ms | Steering angle (0–255, maps to -100%–+100%) |
| `REVERSE` | `REVERSE_signal` | ✅ Yes | 200 ms | Reverse gear active (0 = off, 1 = on) |
| `HAND_BRAKE` | `HAND_BRAKE_signal` | ✅ Yes | 200 ms | Hand brake active (0 = off, 1 = on) |
| `MANUAL_TRANSMISSION` | `MANUAL_TRANSMISSION_signal` | ✅ Yes | 500 ms | Manual gear shift enabled (0 = off, 1 = on) |
| `GEAR` | `GEAR_signal` | ✅ Yes | 200 ms | Current gear value |
| `DOORS` | `DOORS_signal` | ❌ Optional | event-driven | Door open/close toggle |
| `GENERAL_LIGHTS` | `GENERAL_LIGHTS_signal` | ❌ Optional | event-driven | Light state bitmask (0–255) |

> Messages marked as **Required** must be present in any custom DBC file or the platform will refuse to start.
> Messages with **event-driven** period are sent only when the value changes, not periodically.

## What you can customise

While the message names and signal names are fixed by the platform, you are free to change:

- **CAN IDs** — assign any arbitration ID to any message (e.g. change `THROTTLE` from `0x600` to `0x1A0`)
- **Transmission periods** — change the `GenMsgCycleTime` attribute to alter how frequently each message is sent

Changing CAN IDs and transmission periods is the primary way to experiment with network behaviour, such as bus load and arbitration.

## Example: changing a CAN ID and transmission period

The snippet below shows a minimal valid custom DBC that reassigns `THROTTLE` to CAN ID `0x100` and changes its period to 50 ms, while keeping all other messages unchanged:

```text
VERSION ""

BU_: ECU

BO_ 256 THROTTLE: 4 ECU
 SG_ THROTTLE_signal : 0|8@1+ (1,0) [0|255] ""  ECU

... (remaining messages from data/carla.dbc) ...

BA_DEF_ BO_  "GenMsgCycleTime" INT 0 10000;
BA_DEF_DEF_  "GenMsgCycleTime" 0;

BA_ "GenMsgCycleTime" BO_ 256 50;   ← THROTTLE now at 50 ms
... (remaining cycle times) ...
```

Save it as e.g. `data/my_custom.dbc` and run:

```bash
./1_up_environment.sh --dbc data/my_custom.dbc
```

The platform will print a startup summary showing which messages were loaded and their scheduled periods:

```
[CAN] DBC loaded: data/my_custom.dbc
[CAN] Periodic messages scheduled: BRAKE(100ms) GEAR(200ms) HAND_BRAKE(200ms) MANUAL_TRANSMISSION(500ms) REVERSE(200ms) STEER(100ms) THROTTLE(50ms)
```

# Unit Tests

The `tests/` directory contains a pytest suite that verifies the DBC validation rules and the CARLA↔CAN value encoding/decoding formulas. No CARLA server or CAN hardware is required — the SocketCAN bus is mocked and `carla` is replaced by a stub.

Activate the conda environment and run:

```bash
conda activate n4s_env
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Expected output:

```
25 passed in 0.13s
```
